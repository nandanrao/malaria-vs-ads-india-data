abstract = {Cluster Randomised Trials, Second Edition discusses the design, conduct, and analysis of trials that randomise groups of individuals to different treatments. It explores the advantages of cluster randomisation, with special attention given to evaluating the effects of interventions against infectious diseases. Avoiding unnecessary mathematical detail, the book covers basic concepts underlying the use of cluster randomisation, such as direct, indirect, and total effects. In the time since the publication of the first edition, the use of cluster randomised trials (CRTs) has increased substantially, which is reflected in the updates to this edition. There are greatly expanded sections on randomisation, sample size estimation, and alternative designs, including new material on stepped wedge designs. There is a new section on handling ordinal outcome data, and an appendix with descriptions and/or generating code of the example data sets. Although the book mainly focuses on medical and public health applications, it shows that the rigorous evidence of intervention effects provided by CRTs has the potential to inform public policy in a wide range of other areas. The book encourages readers to apply the methods to their own trials, reproduce the analyses presented, and explore alternative approaches.},

abstract = {Summary: We address estimation of intervention effects in experimental designs in which (a) interventions are assigned at the cluster level; (b) clusters are selected to form pairs, matched on observed characteristics; and (c) intervention is assigned to one cluster at random within each pair. One goal of policy interest is to estimate the average outcome if all clusters in all pairs are assigned control versus if all clusters in all pairs are assigned to intervention. In such designs, inference that ignores individual level covariates can be imprecise because cluster-level assignment can leave substantial imbalance in the covariate distribution between experimental arms within each pair. However, most existing methods that adjust for covariates have estimands that are not of policy interest. We propose a methodology that explicitly balances the observed covariates among clusters in a pair, and retains the original estimand of interest. We demonstrate our approach through the evaluation of the Guided Care program.},

Provided a precise definition of imbalance has been specified in advance, unbalanced randomizations can be discarded, followed by a rerandomization, and this process can continue until a randomization yielding balance according to the definition is achieved.

abstract = {Although complete randomization ensures covariate balance on average, the chance of observing significant differences between treatment and control covariate distributions increases with many covariates. Rerandomization discards randomizations that do not satisfy a predetermined covariate balance criterion, generally resulting in better covariate balance and more precise estimates of causal effects. Previous theory has derived finite sample theory for rerandomization under the assumptions of equal treatment group sizes, Gaussian covariate and outcome distributions, or additive causal effects, but not for the general sampling distribution of the difference-in-means estimator for the average causal effect. We develop asymptotic theory for rerandomization without these assumptions, which reveals a non-Gaussian asymptotic distribution for this estimator, specifically a linear combination of a Gaussian random variable and truncated Gaussian random variables. This distribution follows because rerandomization affects only the projection of potential outcomes onto the covariate space but does not affect the corresponding orthogonal residuals. We demonstrate that, compared with complete randomization, rerandomization reduces the asymptotic quantile ranges of the difference-in-means estimator. Moreover, our work constructs accurate large-sample confidence intervals for the average causal effect.},

To demonstrate the methods proposed in this article, we apply them to the National Supported Work (NSW) data, originally analyzed in Lalonde (1986). We also carry out a small simulation study based on the NSW example. In this simulation study, a simple implementation of the bias-corrected matching estimator performs well compared to both simple matching estimators and to regression estimators in terms of bias, root-mean-squared-error,and coverage rates.

abstract = {We present an optimized rerandomization design procedure for a non-sequential treatment-control experiment. Randomized experiments are the gold standard for finding causal effects in nature. But sometimes random assignments result in unequal partitions of the treatment and control group, visibly seen as imbalanced observed covariates, increasing estimator error. There is also imbalance on unobserved covariates which likewise increase estimator error. Rerandomization can throw away poor assignments only in the observed covariates by limiting the imbalance to a prespecified threshold. Limiting this threshold too much can increase the risk of having error due to unobserved covariates. We introduce a criterion that gauges errors due to both imbalance in the observed and the risk of imbalance in the unobserved covariates. We then use this criterion to locate the optimal rerandomization threshold based on the practitioner's level of desired insurance. We also provide an open source R package available on CRAN named OptimalRerandExpDesigns which generates designs according to our algorithm.},

abstract = {In paired experiments, the units included in the randomization, e.g. villages, are matched into pairs, and then one unit of each pair is randomly assigned to treatment. We conducted a survey of papers that used paired randomized experiments in economics. To estimate the treatment effect, researchers usually regress their outcome on a treatment indicator and pair fixed effects, and cluster standard errors at the unit-of-randomization level, namely, at the village level in our example. We show that the variance estimator in this regression may be severely downward biased: under constant treatment effect, its expectation is equal to 1/2 of the true variance. Using that variance estimator may lead researchers to substantially overreject the null of no treatment effect. Instead, we argue that researchers should cluster their standard errors at the pair level.},

abstract = {Although blocking or pairing before randomization is a basic principle of experimental design, the principle is almost invariably applied to at most one or two blocking variables. Here, we discuss the use of optimal multivariate matching prior to randomization to improve covariate balance for many variables at the same time, presenting an algorithm and a case-study of its performance. The method is useful when all subjects, or large groups of subjects, are randomized at the same time. Optimal matching divides a single group of In subjects into n pairs to minimize covariate differences within pairs-the so-called nonbipartite matching problem-then one subject in each pair is picked at random for treatment, the other being assigned to control. Using the baseline covariate data for 132 patients from an actual, unmatched, randomized experiment, we construct 66 pairs matching for 14 covariates. We then create 10000 unmatched and 10000 matched randomized experiments by repeatedly randomizing the 132 patients, and compare the covariate balance with and without matching. By every measure, every one of the 14 covariates was substantially better balanced when randomization was performed within matched pairs. Even after covariance adjustment for chance imbalances in the 14 covariates, matched randomizations provided more accurate estimates than unmatched randomizations, the increase in accuracy being equivalent to, on average, a 7% increase in sample size. In randomization tests of no treatment effect, matched randomizations using the signed rank test had substantially higher power than unmatched randomizations using the rank sum test, even when only 2 of 14 covariates were relevant to a simulated response. Unmatched randomizations experienced rare disasters which were consistently avoided by matched randomizations. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. It also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, while in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},
