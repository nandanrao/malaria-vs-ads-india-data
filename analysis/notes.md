x1. Make CSV with all the info that needs to change in each creative manually created (ref, json for message)

x2. Create adsets via API (no creative)

x3. Create creative via UI (fully)

x4. Get newly created creatives and add new label (notebook)

x5. Will manually created creative hash the same? Check this! It's a good sanity check anyways.

6. Then run everything like normal (creatives already exist, so no change needed).

7. How to deal with "exclude" form??????? It's a different creative... Will have to manually create them too...

For MNM


- Build "big2" of attitude/behavior questions towards malaria.
- Tree to predict 2-week malaria incidence, subgroups of potential interest. (keep it simple)


- Map of malaria vs malaria_now, compare spatial auto-correlation stats.
- Kutcha predics malaria_now more than malaria!!!


- Does covid worry drive bad malaria habits? No



- Is there evidence that those at risk are already taking preventative measures, and does this vary by geography?

- Are the right people worried about malaria?
  in general, potentially not. Although it seems like education might help.


- Is there evidence that malaria is better recognized now than in last 5 years? More prevalent now than in last 5 years?


For facebook execs

- Takeaway should be: maximizing impact involves ensuring exposure in maximum-impact populations. Conversely, maximizing impact in the high-exposure population.

Traditional marketing approach takes the population as fixed and attempts to come up with material that maximizes impact for that population. Traditional statistical subgroup analysis takes the material as fixed and attempts to find populations for which the impact is maximal (and minimal).

- Heterogeneous effects, find subgroups underrepresented with potentially large effect sizes.

- Towards that end we've pushed towards getting sample coverage over those with high malaria risk. This failed. Instead we have high coverage on housing type and geography.

- Plot district incidence on map, show regional correlation, discuss smaller cluster sizes.
